Some recent developments in research, equipment and practical applications are reviewed together with on-going activities. The last NDT-CE conference to be held in the UK was in 1997, and attention is focused on the period since that event. Techniques include subsurface radar, dynamic response, acoustic emission, electrochemical reinforcement corrosion assessment, ultrasonics, chloride detection, magnetic imaging and soils performance, together with pull-out and maturity insitu concrete early age strength estimation. Dissemination of research to industry is considered, including the role of the British Institute of NDT and other organisations such as the Concrete Society and Highways Agency. Potential future trends are noted both in the UK and broader international context.
